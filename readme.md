## What does Josie ML do?
Josie ML gives the user an option to either submit an image or a drawing of a number or an object and uses ML to try to identify the input.  

## Technology used to build it
**Languages:** Python  
**Primary Packages:**
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
**Framework:** Django

## Lessons Learned
1. How to use scikit-learn & matplotlib to train, test, and analyze the performance of a machine learning algorithm using preprepared data.  
2. How to build a website frontend using the Django web framework.

## What's next for Josie ML
1. To refine the user interface to improve the user experience.
2. To train Josie to be able to recognize letters and strings of text.
