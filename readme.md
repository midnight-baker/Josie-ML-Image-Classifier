## Technology used to build it
**Languages:** Python 
**Primary Packages:**
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
**Framework:** Django

## Lessons Learned
1. How to use scikit-learn & matplotlib to train, test, and analyze the performance of a machine learning algorithm using preprepared data.  
2. How to build a website frontend using the Django web framework.

## What's next for Josie ML
